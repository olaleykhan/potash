<h3> Error Page</h3>

<h3> Hi there, I am talking to you from the error page ."Noda Page" (which actually isn't gotten programatically ) was not created, hence svelte automatically redirects you to this error page, I have 
    tried my best not to style it. 
    <br/>
    Now, you may think that perhaps I really am getting this value -"Noda Page" dynamically through some svelte api to get where you were redirected from, because after all. isn't "Noda page" the title of the button I clicked on? Well, I am not.
    <br/>
    so, no matter what /noda/jghkmkjhfudhfofjf" page you try to visit, you will always end up here. lmao. psyche

    <hr/>
    Anyway, soon enough, I will be able to get the page you were redirected from, and I will be able to tell you that you were redirected from the "Noda Page" and not just any page. pschew
